# QGIS-SAML2-Plugin
Open Geospatial Consortium Testbed 13 - SAML2/ECP Plugin for QGIS 2.18.4

This version of the SAML2 plugin for QGIS 2.18.4 was created for OGC Testbed 13 and supports to authenticate with a SAML2 protected OGC Web Service leveraging the SAML2 ECP as described in the OASIS standard https://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/v2.0/saml-profiles-2.0-os.pdf

The details are documented in the public Testbed 13 Engineering Report with the title "OGC Testbed-13: Security ER" that is associated with this project. The report can be downloaded from the OGC website once published (approx. mid. January 2018): http://www.opengeospatial.org/docs/er
